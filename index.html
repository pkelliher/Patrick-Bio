                <p>I'm a Bay Area native, currently living in San Francisco, CA, please see my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y3_R8SHMnsd1NDrOcCZHG4ruwR9ebzKe/view?usp=sharing">resume</a>. I began my high-tech career in High School, working for a POS hardware electronics company called Sable Technologies, then working as desktop support for <a href="http://www.catstest.com/">CATS</a> (Computer Assisted Testing Service) which provided proctored testing for the FAA and FCC, I worked in setting up small LANs (Local Area Networks) for testing centers. I then went on to work as a TSE (Tecnical Support Engineer) for the payment gateway software wing of <a href="https://www.verisign.com">Verisign</a>, later aquired by <a href="https://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a>, supporting small, mid-cap and large Fortune 500 companies, integrating API and HTML based solutions for accepting credit card and ACH transactions. After working at VeriSign Payment Services and PayPal for more than 7 years, I worked as a TSE for <a href="https://www.workshare.com/">Workshare</a>, a collabrative document comparison sofware solution focused on corporate law. I continued in the legal software space working as a QA engineer for <a href=https://www.trackercorp.com>Tracker</a> assiting in testing the revsion of their immigration software offering. I then worked as a TSE at <a href="https://hotpads.com/">Hotpads</a> the rental arm of <a href="https://www.zillow.com">Zillow</a>. I then worked as a TSE at <a href="https://www.mileiq.com">Mile IQ</a> the mileage tracking application owned by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>. Offered a position as an Application Support Specialist at <a href="https://www.opus2.com">Opus 2 International</a>, a promissing start up, I left Microsoft and dove back into legal software realm.</p>
                <p>After a round of layoffs at Opus 2 and losing my Mother and Father, I decided to take some time off from the tech sector and worked construction for a friends company. Although it sounded like a nice change of pace at the time, I soon realized I wasn't built for that kind of work. I then worked as a TSE for <a href="https://www.imgix.com/">imgix</a> supporting companies utilizing the imgix image optimization API. I decided to revamp my technical skills and enrolled in the <a href="https://extension.berkeley.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=32030644">UC Berkeley Full Stack engineering bootcamp</a>. Although proficiant in front-end technologies such as vanilla JavaScript(ES5/ES6), JQuery, HTML5(Bootstrap, Materialize) CSS3 as well as database technologies such as SQL, this bootcamp helped in honing my front-end and back-end knowledge as well as introduce me to other technologies such as NodeJS, ExpressJS web app framework, ReactJS(JSX, Reactstrap), MongoDB(NoSQL) and MySQL. I recently graduated the program and I'm now currently looking for software engineering, technical support or application support engineering posoitions here in the San Francisco Bay Area, please see the portfolio section for projects I built throughout my time in this course.</p>
