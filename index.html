                <p>I'm a Bay Area native, currently living in San Francisco, Ca. I began my high-tech during in High School, working for a POS hardware electronics company called Sable Technologies, then working as desktop support for C.A.T.S. (Computer Assisted Testing Service) which provided proctored testing for the FAA and FCC, I worked in setting up small LANs (Local Area Networks) for testing centers. After that I then went on to work at as a TSE (Tecnical Support Engineer) for VeriSign Payment Services, a payment gateway company for mid to Fortune 500 companies, which was later aquired by PayPal. After working at PayPal for more than a year, I worked for Workshare, a legal collabrative sofware company, then moved on to work as a TSE at HotPads the rental arm of Zillow Inc. I then worked as a TSE at Microsoft for Mile IQ, the mileage tracking app. Having been Offered a position as a TSE at Opus 2 International, a promissing start up, I left MicroSoft and went back into legal software realm.   </p>
                <p>After a round of layoffs at Opus 2 and losing my Mother and Father. I decided to take some time off from the tech space and worked construction for a friends company, it sounded like a nice change of pace at the time, however, realizing that I wasn't built for that kind of work, I decided to revamp my technical skills and enrolled in a U.C. Berkeley Full Stack engineering bootcamp, I reacently graduated the program and I'm now currently looking for software engineering positions. </p>
